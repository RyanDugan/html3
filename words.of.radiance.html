			<p><b>From the back cover:</b></p>
			
			<blockquote cite="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/the-stormlight-archive-series"><p>The Knights Radiant must stand again.</p><p>The ancient oaths have at last been spoken; the spren return. Men seek that which was lost. I fear the struggle will destroy them.</p><p>It is the nature of the magic. A broken soul has cracks into which something else can be fit.  Surgebindings, the powers of creation themselves.  They can brace a broken soul; but they can also widen its fissures.</p><p><b>The Windrunner</b>, lost in a shattered land, balanced upon the boundary between  vengeance and honor. <b>The Lightweaver</b>, slowly being consumed by her past, searching for the lie that she must become. <b>The Bondsmith</b>, born in blood and death, striving to rebuild what was destroyed. <b>The Explorer</b>, straddling the fates of two peoples, forced to  choose between slow death and a terrible betrayal of all she believes.</p><p>It is past time for them to awaken, for the Everstorm looms.</p><p>And <b>the Assassin</b> has arrived.</p></blockquote>
